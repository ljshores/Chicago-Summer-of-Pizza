# Chicago-Summer-of-Pizza
Analysis of the Yelp Reviews of 20 pizza restaurants in Chicago.

As a native Chicagoan, I wanted to dig into a serious question -- who has the best pizza, and what factors may be contributing to these ratings.

I spent a summer eating my way through and rating 20 Chicago pizza joints. Here I scrape the yelp reviews for those restaurants and do some data analysis on the ratings and the text reviews.

Below is a tableau visualization of the personal ratings that we gave the 20 pizza spots.
